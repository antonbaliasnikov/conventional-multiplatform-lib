name: Fast-forward merge

# This workflow helps to work around the bug in the **Rebase and Merge** pull requests strategy.
# The bug leads to unsigned commits and prevents using the strategy
# without IOG policy violation (all commits must be signed by PGP signature).
#
# This workflow helps to merge multiple commits from PR to main branch of the repository
# without loosing PGP signatures.
